# About 
This repo is heavily inspired by Fiona Porter's code which can be found [here](). 

The goal of this repository is to create batches of the MiraBest data-set for use with PyTorch. There are a few options which can be configured in `config.yml`.

The entire pipeline can be run with the script `run_pipeline`. Please note that the `.fits` file downloads are dependent on `SkyView` and may be slow or fail entirely.
